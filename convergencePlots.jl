#This file contains plotting routines for plotting convergence plots
#It is not in plotting.jl so as to avoid having to load Plots.jl in plotting.jl
#This is because loading Plots.jl is slow, and GR is fast.
#Plots.jl is used here because GR is poorly documented and I couldn't figure out how
#to use it
