The `CoherentStructures.jl` package implements several published methodologies
and algorithms. References to the original works can be found in the
documentation of the different methods. In this section, we include code that
reproduces (or imitates) the numerical experiments done in some publications
that have been or can be performed with `CoherentStructures.jl`.

In contrast to the other [examples](@id examples_section), these scripts are not
run every time the documentation gets rebuilt due to computing time limitations,
and are therefore not continuously tested. If you find that some of the following
scripts fail to work, please open an issue on GitHub.
