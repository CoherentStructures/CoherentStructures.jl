# Overview of Examples related to Publications

The `CoherentStructures.jl' package has been used in a number of publications to date,
and many more publications contain algorithms it has implementations of.

In this folder, we include code that reproduces (or imitates) the numerical experiments done in some of these papers.
As the numerical experiments are too involved to recompute the results of each every time this documentation is updated, 
it may happen that future code changes in `CoherentStructures.jl' or other packages cause the code included to fail or behave differently.
Please open an issue on github if you notice that this is the case.
