# # Life cycle assessments of Loop Current rings
#
# The cutting-edge capabilities of automated coherent vortex detection was successfully
# applied ocean surface velocities obtained from satellite altimetry, well-known as the
# AVISO data set. The study was performed by Fernando Andrade-Canto, Daniel Karrasch and
# Francisco Javier Beron-Vera and published in [Physics of Fluids](https://aip.scitation.org/journal/phf)
# as a ["Featured Article"]( https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0030094).
# Details regarding the life cycle assessment can be found in the article, relevant codes
# may be included in the package in the near future and a minimal working example might be
# given here. Stay tuned!
